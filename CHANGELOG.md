## [0.0.9] - 2025-02-05

### Added
- **Folder & File Selection Enhancements:**  
  The "Add File Content to Project Context" command now supports selecting both files and folders. When a folder is selected, all files within it (recursively) are addedâ€”along with any individually selected files. Duplicate files are automatically skipped.
- **Clickable Status Bar:**  
  The status bar now displays the current number of files in context and is clickable. Clicking it opens a QuickPick list that allows users to remove any file directly.
- **New Command - Show Files in Project Context:**  
  Added the `copy-project-context.showContextList` command, which lists all files in the context and provides easy management options.
- **Actionable Notifications:**  
  Enhanced notifications now offer clear feedback and direct actions to improve overall user workflow.

### Improved
- **Direct Copy Functionality:**  
  The "Copy Project Context" command now copies the formatted project context directly to the clipboard without a preview step.
- **User Feedback & Error Handling:**  
  Improved error messages and user feedback during file operations (adding, removing, and copying) provide more detailed guidance.
- **Command Palette & Keybindings:**  
  Updated command names and keybindings (e.g., `Ctrl+Shift+C` for copying and `Ctrl+Shift+A` for adding files) to streamline workflows.
